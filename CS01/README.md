# Welcome to the CS01 Set of Cores

CS01 is designed to be educational in nature containing the most prominent features of "real" processing cores with some of the more complex details left out. CS01 is based around a RISCV core. CS01 is non-overlapped pipelined processor that can fit in a small FPGA (5,000 LUTs).
