# FP Unit Benches

*_tv.txt contains test vector data and results generated by an HP workstation.
The format is:
---result in hex----operand B in hex----operand A in hex

The operands and the results are the same size.
It may be a little difficult to read as all the values are in hex with no spacing, but a good compare utility is useful to compare with the results generate by the core.

*_tvo.txt contains the test output generated by the core from the test benches.
The corresponding *_tv.txt and *_tvo.txt files were compared to verify the cores output.

*_tv.txt is for single precision
*_tvd.txt is for double precision
