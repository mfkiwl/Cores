# Graphics

This folder contains some of the graphics routines worked on back in the early
'90s. There is a far bit of assembler code for the '286 processor.
Hand coded and optimized for each graphics mode.
At the time these routines were written they were blindinlgy fast due to the 
use of self-modifying code for raster operations. IIRC the routines were about
2 to 10x, yes 10x! faster than code supplied in common libaries.

Only part of the code is presented here. It is probably not possible to build
the library.
